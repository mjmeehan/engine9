    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>This manual page documents briefly the
      <command>&dhpackage;</command> game.</para>

    <para>This manual page was written for the &debian; distribution
      because the original program does not have a manual page.
      </para>

      <para>
      The goal of the game is to be the last one, who is alive. You can drop bombs which will explode after a certain time and destroy everything in horizontal and vertical direction. So you can remove stones or kill other players. But take care. Don't kill yourself otherwise the game will be over for you.
      </para>
<para>
During the game you will find different powerups to raise your skills. If you are running faster than your opponent and you have many bombs, you can catch him within lots of bombs and he has no chance to escape.
</para>
<para>
You will get points for every player you have killed. If you win the game, you can earn additional points depending on how many players played the game.
</para>
