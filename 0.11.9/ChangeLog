- Fixed BUG found by Lars Poeschel
  One player could join without problems and if a second player joined
  this network game, the server crashed in do_contest() accessing
  illegal memory. The problem is that a contest packet is received with
  to -1 and from 1. Then in the line
	players[ct_pkg->to].net.flags &= (0xFF - NETF_firewall);
  obviously illegal memory is accessed.
  Fixed the check of the to parameter from the contest packet. The 
  server ignores now a to value of -1.

- Changed Docdir to $prefix/share/doc (Felipe Rafailov)

- Added some more resolutions. (requested by some users)

- Fixed BUG shown in: http://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=242031
  (patch from: Petr Gajdos)
  In network game i wanted to use all the time a different bomb 
  instead of the first free aviable. In the code i forgot to modify
  some values. This patch should fix it now.
  (player.c:player_findfreebomb) changed i to nr.

- Fixed some drawing issues with flying bombs.

  special.use (was reset during special_clean)

  gfx gots selected and deselected. (infinite loop on the network)

Version 0.11.7
==============
2006-08-15

- Added: BomberClone Icon to the bomberclone win32 binary.

- Added: resolution 1280x800

- Testing: Security Problems found by Luigi Auriemma
  Bugs: A] memcpy crash in rscache_add
        B] information disclosure in send_pkg
        C] simple error message termination
  for more informations look here:
  http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/bcloneboom-adv.txt
  Solutions to 
  A) rewrote the whole resend cache system, also send_mapinfo needed a
     bad workaround for a bug i couldn't find out. (to disable the workaround
     use ./configure CFLAGS=-DBUG_MAPINFO)
  B) made sure that the size of a packet is set right before send over
     the network. Found only the function (do_gameinfo) where something 
     like this occured.
	 do_pkg will also check the size of the incoming packet with the 
	 p->h.len value.
  C) accept the error packets only from the server of a game. Since only the
     server will send such type of packets.

- Fixed: Security Problem found by Stefan Cornelius.
  For more information look here:
  https://lists.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/sec-info/Week-of-Mon-20060313/006561.html
    
- Added: "more random" by Patrik Nilsson:
  This map type is just a hacked version of "autogenerated",
  and is as the name tells more random. Since both block, 
  rock and nothing are placed randomly inside the border.

  This fix was made by Chris E..
 
- Fixed: Bug with more as 8 diffrent player graphics.
  The window size hasen't changed if there where more as
  8 different player graphics to choose from.

- Removed the Dedicated Server Support from the game.
  The whole bomberclone game is not desinged for a dedicated
  server. The test shown that the whole game would have to
  be rewritten. Also that the host can leave the game would
  not work no more.

Version 0.11.6.2
- Client network player could die two times in a game.
  After receiving the playerdata packet from a client did the
  server first the player_set_gfx routine first. Which send a
  playerid packet with a alife player back.
  Changed: player_set_gfx routine will be called after setting 
  the state of a player.
  Also do_playerid will check if the game is not running 
  or the player is still alife to set this value.
- Dedicated server support (only testing).

  set to 0.

  part of the explosion_restore function. Explosion

- AI: Player die on a slow computer because they move more 
  as 1 Field. This might be also the problem Acidjnk told
  me about.

  usualy used for all/the most type of network 
  connection.
